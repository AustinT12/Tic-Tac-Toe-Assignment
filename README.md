# Tic-Tac-Toe-Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to create a player versus AI tic-tac-toe game. In this game, it is impossible to defeat the AI because it was designed with the minimax algorithm. The minimax algorithm is a decision rule backtracking algorithm that is commonly used in artificial intelligence to find the optimal move for a player. In the assignment, the AI assesses the players moves and makes decisions on which move is optimal for winning. It is able to see all of the resulting outcomes on the board from the player's moves. Since the AI is able to see many steps ahead, it is nearly impossible to win against it.
